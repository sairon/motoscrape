Motoscrape
==========

This project is a simple Scrapy-based tool that crawls a few websites
that publish motorcycle advertisements and sends periodic reports
through email.

The code style and other aspects of the code are probably far away from
the best practices. Its purpose is just to do the job it was made for
and maybe - show how it's easy to make a working Scrapy crawler.
